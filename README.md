# My music server

Just a music server, so chill, even the performance is taking a break. (it's not that bad, though).

## Features

- [x] Serve music files with metadata, use `graphql`
- [x] Serve album art
- [x] Watch music files changes and update the database

### TODO

- [ ] Refactor the code, because it's a mess. I just want to make it work first. (I might never do this)
- [ ] Add more query options, allow sorting, filtering, etc
- [ ] Improve the performance, yes I know it's should be the first thing to do, but as I said, it's not that bad
- [ ] Other stuffs that I haven't thought of yet
